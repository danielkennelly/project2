Notes on Plots
--------------
Refer to R files on plots 1-3 for information regarding methods applied to data.

For plots 4-6, refer to R files. Data for plot 4 were subset from the NEI database via a reg-ex search applied to the "Short.Name" category of the "Source_Classification_Code.rds" file. The results of the reg-ex search were used to create a list of SCC ids to pull from the NEI data.
Data for plots 5-6 were subset via a visual inspection of the file "SCC.csv", which was created by outputting a list of the "Short.Name" values in "Source_Classification_Code.rds". Visual inspection yielded the necessary range of SCC ids for use in subsetting the NEI data.
